# Dynamic Programming â€“ Count all paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix
# Objective: Given two dimensional matrix, write an algorithm to count all possible
# paths from top left corner to bottom-right corner. You are allowed to move only
# in two directions, move right OR move down.
